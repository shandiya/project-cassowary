# Created by use_targets().
# Follow the comments below to fill in this target script.
# Then follow the manual to check and run the pipeline:
#   https://books.ropensci.org/targets/walkthrough.html#inspect-the-pipeline # nolint

# Load packages required to define the pipeline:
library(targets)
# library(tarchetypes) # Load other packages as needed. # nolint

# Set target options:
tar_option_set(
  packages = c("readr", "dplyr", "mvabund", "magrittr"), # packages that your targets need to run
  format = "rds" # default storage format
  # Set other options as needed.
)

# tar_make_clustermq() configuration (okay to leave alone):
options(clustermq.scheduler = "multicore")

# tar_make_future() configuration (okay to leave alone):
future::plan(future.callr::callr)

# Run the R scripts in the R/ folder with your custom functions:
tar_source()
# source("other_functions.R") # Source other scripts as needed. # nolint

# Replace the target list below with your own:
list(
  tar_target(name = data, command = get_data()),
  tar_target(name = bird_subset, command = get_bird_sample(data)),
  tar_target(name = data_subset, command = get_small_dataset(data, bird_subset)),
  tar_target(name = model, command = fit_glm(data_subset))
)
